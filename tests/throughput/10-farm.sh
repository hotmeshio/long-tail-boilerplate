# 10-farm — Single-command orchestrator for the print-routing farm simulation.
#
# The two convergent surfaces of the farm, driven as two processes:
#   [supply]  the printer fleet + the autonomous crew (broker/technician/inspector)
#   [demand]  waves of orders that need printing
#
# It powers on supply, waits for the "SUPPLY READY" sentinel (capturing RUN_ID),
# releases demand, then waits for demand to converge. Demand owns the pass/fail
# gate (exit 0 = every order printed & signed off). When demand finishes, supply
# is torn down (its crew also self-terminates on idle). Ctrl-C kills everything.
#
# Env vars (all optional, sensible defaults):
#   FLEET_SIZE         — printers in the fleet (default 2)
#   DAILY_VOLUME       — total orders (default 12)
#   BATCHES            — order waves (default 2)
#   WAVE_GAP_S         — seconds between waves (default 5; the pressure-gradient knob)
#   COMPRESSION_HOURS  — alt: spread all waves across this window (ortho-style compression)
#   DIABETIC           — 1 to run the diabetic fleet (default standard)
#
# Capacity rule: FLEET_SIZE × 10 (EOL runs) must exceed DAILY_VOLUME or demand
# stalls once the fleet retires. Seed operators first: npm run print:seed
#
# Usage:
#   npm run print:run
#   FLEET_SIZE=6 DAILY_VOLUME=50 BATCHES=5 npm run print:run
