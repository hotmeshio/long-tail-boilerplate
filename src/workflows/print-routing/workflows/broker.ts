/**
 * printBroker — the market maker. A looping durable singleton (run several per fleet
 * for throughput; carry-forward keeps them disjoint). Each tick: place the carried
 * backlog, claim fresh demand by priority sized to free capacity, batch-lock the
 * printers and hand off, then harvest every printer's completion in parallel and
 * settle. The broker is the durable coordinator; the saga is crash-safe-forward.
