/**
 * printShift — the invocable entry target: one click runs the whole farm.
 *
 * Kicking it off opens a shift. The shift powers on the machines and the
 * dispatcher (broker) + the technician + the inspector — durable loops that work
 * the floor and self-terminate once it's idle — then feeds order *flavors* through
 * in waves, each a different dimension (priority, defect/convergence, lifecycle).
 * A small `Durable.sleep` beats between waves so the trace reads like a real shift.
 *
 * The dispatcher runs for as long as there is work and no longer; the shift
 * completes when every order has converged. It then powers down any printer the
 * work no longer needs, so nothing lingers — everything is bounded. The whole run
 * is a query over the escalation trail: what was intended, what happened, how long
 * each print took, what was retried, and when each machine retired.
