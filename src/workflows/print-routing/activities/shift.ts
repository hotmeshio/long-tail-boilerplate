 * and crosses its refills at runs 3/6/9. Combined run capacity sits just above the
 * order book, so one machine reaches end-of-life on its own while the other still
 * has life left when the floor clears — and is powered down. Both ways of bounding
 * a printer show: a natural retirement and an explicit power-down.
 *
 * Demand — three waves, each a dimension:
 *   rush       priority: one key-account order amid standard ones; the broker
 *              claims it first.
 *   defect     convergence: one order with a defective unit; the fixpoint loop
 *              reprints it until intent ≡ actual.
 *   closing    capacity/lifecycle: the remaining orders that drive the refills and
