/**
 * Printer-side activity — the printer's "print": run the job, then report completion
 * by RESOLVING the broker's callback escalation (`signal_key = callbackKey`). The
 * escalation is the boundary where the physical outcome re-enters the digital twin:
 * resolving double-fires `wfs.signal` + `wfs.wait`, which is what resumes the broker's
 * *collated* wait (a raw signal would not).
 *
 * One atomic call does it all (`resolveEscalationBySignalKey` → HotMesh `resolve`): the
 * status-guarded UPDATE marks the row resolved, delivers the signal, AND merges the
 * outcome patch into the GIN-indexed metadata — together or not at all. We never read
 * the row to compute anything: its own `created_at` (handoff) → `resolved_at` (done) IS
 * the print duration, derivable by query, so there is nothing to store or stitch.
 *
 * The broker opens that row right after the handoff wakes us, so the resolve may not find
 * it on the first try; retry briefly until it exists.
