/**
 * Priority policy — the business layer. When more orders are claimable than there
 * are printers free, *which runs first* is a business decision, so it lives where
 * the business can reach it: a registry of named rules, each a sort fragment, and
 * an ordered list naming the rules to apply. The broker composes the list into a
 * `FacetOrder[]` and hands it to `claimGroups` — it never hard-codes the sequence.
 *
 * Each rule is legible and independent. Reorder the list, or pass a different one
 * per broker (`BrokerData.priorityRules`), and the queue reorders — no code change
 * in the broker, no deploy. This is the funnel's fourth stage made pluggable.
