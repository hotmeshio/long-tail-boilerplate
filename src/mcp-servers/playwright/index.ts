/**
 * Create a Playwright Browser MCP server.
 *
 * Provides 9 tools for browser automation:
 *   navigate, screenshot, click, fill, wait_for, evaluate, run_script, list_pages, close_page
 *
 * All page-scoped tools participate in the _handle convention:
 * - navigate returns a _handle in its result
 * - All other tools accept _handle to locate the page across activities
 * - Fast path: local pages Map (same container)
 * - Slow path: CDP reconnection (different container)
 *
 * `run_script` is the preferred tool for YAML workflows — it executes a
 * multi-step browser script in a single activity, avoiding cross-activity
 * session issues entirely.
 *
 * Returns a fresh McpServer instance each time. The browser is shared
 * and lazy-launched on first tool call.
